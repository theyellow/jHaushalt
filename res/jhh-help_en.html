<h1>Welcome!</h1>
One remark at the beginning: Since my English is not 
perfect please be lenient with this translation. Corrections and improvements
are always welcome!

Below you will find some quick hints for the use of <i>jHaushalt</i>. If you have 
any further questions or problems, please see the forum at
<a href="http://www.jhaushalt.de/">http://www.jhaushalt.de/</a>. At this place you will
also find the newest version of <i>jHaushalt</i>.

<h3>General</h3>
<i>jHaushalt</i> distinguishes between different accounts. Examples of accounts
are "cash", "current account" or "savings account”. At program start
automatically a first register will be created. Within the register individual
postings could be entered. A register consist of 
<ul>
<li>date, 
<li>posting text, 
<li>category and 
<li>amount.
</ul>
The amount of a posting may be positive or negative, depending on either income
or expenditure. Postings can be split, i.e. the amount of a posting can be split
on different categories. Normal postings can be directly entered in the last row
of a register. In addition, there are repostings. These are postings between
different registers. Repostings can not be directly entered in the register, but by
clicking on the respective button. 

<h3>Special Keys</h3>
A special feature is the delete key. With this key a whole field can be erased.
This function can be changed under 'Options'. <br>
With the help of the plus ('+')
and minus ('-') keys a date can be easily increased or decreased. 

<h3>QIF import</h3>
It is possible to import data from a QIF file. Before you can import your data,
you have to export all register from "Q**ck*n" to the QIF file format. Before starting
the import in <i>jHaushalt</i> 
at least one account must exist. The name of this account
must necessarily match with the register which is imported (The file name does
not matter!). By importing the first register <i>jHaushalt</i> will
automatically create all other required accounts. The import must be done for each
account individually. All accounts must be imported separately to complete the full import. 
Otherwise some postings would be missing, since only the positive postings are imported. 
Following is a short summary of required steps: 
<ol>
  <li>Export all registers from "Qu**ck*n"
  <li>Create the first account in <i>jHaushalt</i> by yourself
  <li>Import first account
  <li>Repeat import for each additional account
</ol>
I have successfully tested the import function in combination with "Q**ck*n 98".
Other versions of "Q**ck*n" may not work properly. For the purpose of testing I have included 
two files 'Kasse.qif' and 'Bankkonto.qif' in the program archive. 

<h3>Repeating postings</h3>
It is possible to process automatically recurring postings. Repeating postings
are e.g. the apartment's rent or your own salary. At every start-up <i>jHaushalt</i> checks 
if it is necessary to execute automated postings. A repeating posting can be deleted with 
'Alt-D'.
